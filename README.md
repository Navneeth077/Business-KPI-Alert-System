🚀 CEO Anomaly Detection & KPI Alert System
An automated, serverless data pipeline designed to shift business intelligence from reactive to proactive. This system monitors live revenue streams in a cloud database and pushes instant alerts to stakeholders when performance anomalies are detected.

Database: Powered by Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL)

Automation: Managed by GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

🛠️ The Problem & The Solution
The Problem: Executives often discover revenue drops hours or days after they occur because they rely on manual dashboard checks.
The Solution: This "CEO Bot" acts as a 24/7 sentinel. It performs hourly SQL batch comparisons. If it detects a >20% drop in revenue velocity, it triggers a high-priority Slack alert with formatted "Block Kit" data.

🏗️ Technical Architecture
Data Ingestion: A Python-based simulation engine pushes randomized transactional data (revenue, costs, segments) into a Neon PostgreSQL instance.

Analysis Engine: A monitoring script calculates performance by comparing the most recent data batch against the previous period using SQL windowing logic.

Automated Orchestration: GitHub Actions wakes up a virtual Linux environment every hour to execute the analysis.

Secure Infrastructure: All database credentials and API webhooks are managed via GitHub Secrets (AES-256 encryption) to prevent credential leakage.

Frontend Visualization: A Streamlit web application provides a real-time UI for non-technical stakeholders to visualize trends.

🔐 Security & Reliability
Environment Variables: Utilizes os.getenv to ensure no sensitive URIs are hardcoded in the source code.

Defensive Programming: Includes robust error handling for database connection timeouts and division-by-zero errors in performance calculations.

Linux Compatibility: Configured for case-sensitive Linux environments (GitHub Runners).
